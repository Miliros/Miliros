<h1>Hello! I'm Milagros Rosales
 a full stack web developer, focused on front end design. üëã</h1>

<h2>MY PROJECTS:</h2>
<h3>Poke Api</h3>
<p>Individual project developed within Henry Bootcamp. It is a SPA that is built using technologies like React and Redux in the Frontend for efficient state management, and CSS modules for style management.
The SPA consumes data from the external api (‚ÄúPoke API‚Äù) and communicates with a Back End developed in Node.js using Express to handle client requests. The application uses Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
The user can create a Pok√©mon, search for it by name, filter it by type and strength, as well as sort it alphabetically.</p>

<h3>Rick and Morty</h3>
<p>Integrator project developed within Henry Bootcamp is a SPA that uses React for the Front End and Redux as state management. All components were developed with CSS without the use of external libraries.
The SPA consumes data from an API ("The Rick and Morty API") through a Back-End developed in Node.JS using Express, adding new features to the original API.
The user can search for a character, filter by gender, sort alphabetically and add to favorites.</p>
